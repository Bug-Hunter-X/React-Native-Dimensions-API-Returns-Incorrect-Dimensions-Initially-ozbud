This bug occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions.  The dimensions are initially incorrect or zero, causing layout issues or rendering problems. This often happens when the app is launched or when the screen orientation changes.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const {width, height} = Dimensions.get('window');
console.log('width:', width, 'height:', height); // might log 0, 0 initially
```
